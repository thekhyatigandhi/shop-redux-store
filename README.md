# shop-redux-store

Shop Shop is an e-commerce site in which you can purchase products and checkout using stripe. This application is refactor of the original [Shop-Shop](https://github.com/thekhyatigandhi/shop-redux-store) which used Reactâ€™s Context API to handle global state. Shop Shop Redux uses the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) library to handle global state.
